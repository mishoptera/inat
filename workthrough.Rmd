```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Individual Species EDA

The goal of this is to focus in on individual species in iNat to look for cool patterns.  First, I"m going to utliize the dataset from CNC, but eventually I"m going to pull out patterns directly from the iNaturalist database.

```{r loadup}
# load libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(vegan)
library(ggmap)
library(ggrepel)
library(ggpubr)
library(stringr)

# load files
load('data/all_inat.Rdata')
load('data/cities.Rdata')
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
