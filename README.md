# iNaturalist data exploration
This repository sets up an initial generic framework for exploring iNaturalist observations on a species by species basis in major US cities.

## Why?
Citizen science observations are useful for asking questions surrounding species distribution patterns.  This can then be combined with other environmental datasets to see which variables may be associated.

## The Data
iNaturalist data is pulled from the iNat database through the 'rinat' package. NLCD data is pulled through the 'FedData' package.

## The Analyses
TBD...
